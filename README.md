This is a one-player Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game data is saved to a separate file (either gamedata1.txt or gamedata2.txt).
From there, when you play against the computer, it will pull data from previous games to determing its next move.

If enough games are played, then the computer will become proficient enought to beat the player (or at least tie).
